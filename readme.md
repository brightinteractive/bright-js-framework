A batteries-included React framework for rapidly developing fast, testable, desktop-calibre web apps in React.


Getting started:
==

Documentation and quickstart guides can be found on the project site. The rest of this readme is only of interest if you want to work on the framework itself.

Development guide
==

Prerequisites
--
Node 8.3+ or higher.

This repo uses gulp as a task runner. Which is *so* 2015, but it fits the range of build tasks this library needs quite well. You will need to install the gulp cli in order to run the build commands:

```
npm i -g gulp-cli
```


Initial setup
---

This repo uses npm to manage dependencies. It also includes a helpful pre-commit script, which auto-fixes minor linting and code formatting issues that are irritating to handle manually (indentation, quote styles, etc).

```
npm install
gulp

# Optional: symlink githook scripts
ln -s ../../githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

Running test/ci scripts
---

Running individual CI tasks:

* `gulp typecheck`
* `gulp lint`
* `gulp test`
* `gulp coverage`

To run everything that the CI runs against open pull requests:

* `gulp`

To run on file change:

* `gulp watch`


Running local framework changes against an application
---

It may sometimes be useful to develop this framework against a live-reloading application.
You can symlink a local copy of the framework into your app's node_modules by running:

```
cd (path to framework)
npm link
cd (path to your app)
npm link @brightinteractive/bright-js-framework
```

Note that you'll need to do this again whenever you `npm install` in your app.

By default, webpack will only monitor changes to the transpiled javascript from this library, not the source typescript files. To rebuild on source changes, use `gulp watch:rebuild`.

To revert to the previously installed version:

`npm unlink @brightinteractive/bright-js-framework`

To replace with the latest version after merging to master:

`npm install @brightinteractive/bright-js-framework@latest`


Release workflow
---

Releases are auto-deployed on merge to master if the version in package.json has incremented.


Documentation
---

Documentation is autogenerated from typescript files in [src/api](/bright-js-framework/tree/master/src/api). The documentation site is deployed on merge to master and built using [gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org). Site templates live in [/site](/bright-js-framework/tree/master/docs-site/)

Pull requests must include documentation for new or updated APIs. This may consist of either header-docs or high-level conceptual documentation or both.

For information about working on the documentation, refer to the docsite's [readme](/bright-js-framework/blob/master/docs-site/README.md)
