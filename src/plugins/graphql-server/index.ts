/**
 * Base class for implementing resolver maps.

 * ResolverMaps are collections of resolver functions, each one being responsible for defining
 * how to resolve properties declared in an APIâ€™s schema.
 *
 * When a resolver function is written for a scalar property (such as a string or number), it should
 * return either the scalar value or (more typically) a Promise for the scalar value.
 *
 * When a resolver function is written for a relation to another object, it should not fetch the
 * object, but instead return a string ID for that object. This is then provided to
 * that Object's ResolverMap as its id property, which can then be used by the functions within the ResolverMap to fetch data
 * about it from backend services.
